# SQL-Blog-Database

# SQL Blog Database Project  

Designed and implemented a relational database for a blogging platform.  
Includes schema design, data population, and analytical SQL queries.  

## Key Features
- Created normalized tables for **users, posts, comments, tags, photos, likes, and reads**.  
- Enforced data integrity with **primary/foreign keys, unique constraints, and referential integrity rules**.  
- Inserted realistic sample data to simulate a live blogging environment.  
- Wrote advanced **SQL SELECT queries** to analyze:  
  - Most active authors and commenters  
  - Posts by tags (DIY, baking, etc.)  
  - Posts with missing or inconsistent metadata  
  - Engagement metrics (likes, reads, comments per post)  

## Tools & Technologies
- MySQL  
- SQL (DDL, DML, Queries)  

## Deliverables
- `CREATE_TABLE_COMMANDS.sql` – schema definitions  
- `INSERT_COMMANDS.sql` – sample data population  
- `Select_queries.sql` – analytical queries  
- `Blog_Backup.sql` – full database backup
